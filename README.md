# Yaz
A yahtzee clone for Android

This game was written using RemObjects Elements Technology. It is available for free here https://www.remobjects.com/elements/silver/
I used Android Studio for the game layout.

This is 100% Swift code.  You can look at this project to learn how to use RemObject Silver or just how to create a dice game.
